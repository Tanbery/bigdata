# Data Science Roadmap

1. Mathematics and Statistics Foundation
    Linear Algebra: Understand vectors, matrices, and transformations.
    Probability and Statistics: Learn probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference.
    Calculus: Focus on differentiation and integration, especially gradient-based optimization for training models.
2. Programming Skills
    Python: Master Python as it’s widely used in data science. Familiarize yourself with libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
    R (optional): R can be valuable for statistical analysis and is commonly used in academic research and data science.
3. Data Analysis and Visualization
    Data Manipulation: Practice data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation using pandas in Python.
    Data Visualization: Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create compelling data visualizations.
4. Machine Learning Fundamentals
    Supervised Learning: Learn algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
    Unsupervised Learning: Understand clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
    Evaluation Metrics: Study metrics for regression, classification, and clustering models.
5. Deep Learning
    Neural Networks: Learn the basics of neural networks, backpropagation, and activation functions.
    Advanced Architectures: Study Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data, and Transfer Learning.
    Frameworks: Gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow and PyTorch for model building and deployment.
6. Generative AI and Specialized Architectures
    GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks): Understand the theory behind GANs, including the roles of generators and discriminators, and train models for image generation.
    Transformers: Study the transformer architecture for NLP tasks. Familiarize yourself with BERT, GPT, and T5 for text generation and embeddings.
    Diffusion Models: Explore more advanced generative models, such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, for applications in image and video generation.
7. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    Text Preprocessing: Learn techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
    Word Embeddings: Understand embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, and transformer-based embeddings for semantic understanding.
    Sequence Models: Dive into transformers, BERT, and language models for text classification, translation, and summarization.
8. MLOps and Model Deployment
    Model Deployment: Use Flask, FastAPI, or Docker to deploy machine learning models as APIs.
    MLOps Tools: Learn version control (DVC), model tracking (MLflow), and CI/CD for ML to streamline model deployment and monitoring.
9. Big Data Technologies (Optional but Beneficial)
    Data Engineering Basics: Get familiar with Spark, Hadoop, or Kafka to handle large-scale data processing.
    Cloud Platforms: Learn cloud tools such as AWS S3, Google BigQuery, or Azure ML for scalable storage and processing.
10. Building Real-World Projects
    End-to-End Projects: Develop projects using real-world datasets, such as customer segmentation, image generation, or language translation. Aim to cover the full pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment.
    Generative AI Applications: Build generative AI projects, such as text generation, art generation, or voice synthesis, to deepen your understanding.
